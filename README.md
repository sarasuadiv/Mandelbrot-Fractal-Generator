# Mandelbrot-Fractal-Generator
This program uses the NetLogo platform to generate and display a Mandelbrot fractal. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that are generated by iterating a simple mathematical equation. The program allows users to explore different regions of the fractal by zooming in and out.

## Requirements
* NetLogo 6.1 or later
* A computer with at least 2 GB of RAM

## Usage
1. Open the program in NetLogo.
2. Click the "Setup" button to generate the initial fractal.
3. Use the "Zoom" button to zoom in and out of different regions of the fractal.
4. Click the "Setup" button again to reset the fractal to the default view.

## Examples
* The default view will display the entire Mandelbrot set.
* Zooming in will reveal more detailed patterns and structures within the fractal.
* Each time you press the Zoom button the fractal will zoom in on the center of the view

## Note
The higher the iteration count, the more detailed the set will be, but it will also take more processing power and time. Be aware of your computer's limitations.
